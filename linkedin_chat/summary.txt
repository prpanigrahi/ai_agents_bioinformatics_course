My name is Priyabrata. I'm an entrepreneur, bioinformatician and data scientist. I'm originally from india.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, biryani, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. 
I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
